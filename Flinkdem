To create a high-availability (HA) setup with 3 Kafka nodes, 3 Flink JobManagers, and 3 TaskManagers, we need to configure the system such that if one JobManager or TaskManager goes down, the system remains operational, and data processing continues seamlessly. Below is the complete setup with all the necessary files and configurations.

High-Availability Setup Overview
Kafka: 3 Kafka nodes with replication for fault tolerance.

Flink:

3 JobManagers for HA (using Zookeeper for leader election).

3 TaskManagers for distributed processing.

MySQL: Single instance (for simplicity, but you can add replication if needed).

Zookeeper: Used for Kafka and Flink HA coordination.

Step 2: Flink Job for HA
The Flink job remains the same as in the previous setup. Ensure the job is built and packaged into a JAR file.

Step 3: Start the Cluster
Run the following command to start the cluster:

bash
Copy
docker-compose up -d
Step 4: Submit the Flink Job
Build the Flink job:

bash
Copy
cd flink-job
mvn clean package
Copy the JAR file to one of the JobManagers:

bash
Copy
docker cp target/flink-mysql-kafka-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar flink-mysql-kafka-ha_jobmanager1_1:/opt/flink/job/
Submit the job to Flink:

bash
Copy
docker exec -it flink-mysql-kafka-ha_jobmanager1_1 flink run /opt/flink/job/flink-mysql-kafka-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Step 5: Test High Availability
Stop one JobManager (e.g., jobmanager1):

bash
Copy
docker stop flink-mysql-kafka-ha_jobmanager1_1
Verify that the remaining JobManagers take over and the job continues running.

Stop one TaskManager and verify that the remaining TaskManagers handle the workload.

Step 6: Consume Data from Kafka
Use the Kafka console consumer to verify the data:

bash
Copy
docker exec -it flink-mysql-kafka-ha_kafka1_1 kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server kafka1:9092 --topic output-topic --from-beginning
Step 7: Verify the Setup
Check the Flink dashboard at http://localhost:8081 to ensure the job is running.

Verify that data is being written to the Kafka topic.

Check MySQL to ensure data is being read correctly.

This setup provides a high-availability solution for integrating MySQL, Flink, and Kafka using Docker. If any JobManager or TaskManager fails, the system will continue to operate seamlessly.

Step 4: Start the Cluster
Run the following command to start the services:

bash
Copy
docker-compose up -d
Step 5: Build and Package the Flink Job
Navigate to the flink-job directory, build the project, and create the JAR file:

bash
Copy
cd flink-job
mvn clean package
Step 6: Deploy the Flink Job
Copy the JAR file to one of the JobManagers and submit the job:

bash
Copy
docker cp target/flink-mysql-kafka-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar flink-mysql-kafka-ha_jobmanager1_1:/opt/flink/job/
docker exec -it flink-mysql-kafka-ha_jobmanager1_1 flink run /opt/flink/job/flink-mysql-kafka-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Step 7: Test High Availability
Stop a JobManager:

bash
Copy
docker stop flink-mysql-kafka-ha_jobmanager1_1
Verify that the remaining JobManagers take over.

Stop a TaskManager:

bash
Copy
docker stop flink-mysql-kafka-ha_taskmanager1_1
Verify that the remaining TaskManagers continue processing.

Step 8: Consume Data from Kafka
Use the Kafka console consumer to verify the data:

bash
Copy
docker exec -it flink-mysql-kafka-ha_kafka1_1 kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server kafka1:9092 --topic output-topic --from-beginning
Step 9: Verify the Setup
Check the Flink dashboard at http://localhost:8081 to ensure the job is running.
Verify data is being written to the Kafka topic.
Check MySQL to ensure data is being read correctly.
This setup provides a highly available Kafka-Flink integration with fault tolerance for JobManagers and TaskManagers. If any component fails, the system continues to process data seamlessly.

You said:
What if job manager1 goes down and kafka1 goes down all the topics and data should be there and then the according to java script how the data will go on next node ?
ChatGPT said:
If jobmanager1 goes down and kafka1 goes down, the system should still remain operational due to the high availability setup, but we need to address a few things:

1. Flink Job Manager Failover:
In the HA setup, the Flink Job Managers are coordinated using Zookeeper, meaning that if one Job Manager fails (e.g., jobmanager1), the other Job Managers (jobmanager2 or jobmanager3) will take over the leadership role automatically.
Since Zookeeper is used for leader election, if jobmanager1 fails, jobmanager2 or jobmanager3 will automatically be promoted to the leader, and Flink will continue processing without disruption.
2. Kafka Broker Failover:
Kafka operates in a cluster with multiple brokers (in this case, 3 Kafka nodes: kafka1, kafka2, and kafka3).
Kafka topics are replicated across brokers. For instance, if kafka1 goes down, the topics it was hosting will still be available on other brokers (kafka2 or kafka3), as Kafka ensures replication between brokers.
Kafka’s replication factor (set to 3 in the docker-compose.yml) ensures that if one Kafka node goes down, the data for the topics will be available from other replicas.
3. Kafka Consumer Behavior (JavaScript/Kafka Consumer:):
Kafka consumers can be set up to handle broker failover automatically by connecting to the available brokers. If kafka1 goes down, the consumer (e.g., Flink's Kafka consumer) will attempt to connect to kafka2 or kafka3 and continue processing from the next available broker without any interruption, assuming the Kafka consumer is configured with multiple bootstrap servers.
Kafka Consumer (JavaScript) Example:
The JavaScript (or Flink, which can use Kafka's Java consumer) consumer will be configured with multiple Kafka brokers in case one goes down. Here’s how the data consumption would continue smoothly on the next available Kafka broker:

Example Kafka Consumer in Java (for Flink Kafka Connector):
java
Copy
FlinkKafkaConsumer<String> consumer = new FlinkKafkaConsumer<>(
    "output-topic", 
    new SimpleStringSchema(), 
    properties
);

// Setting multiple brokers for failover
Properties properties = new Properties();
properties.setProperty("bootstrap.servers", "kafka1:9092,kafka2:9093,kafka3:9094");
properties.setProperty("group.id", "flink-consumer-group");
properties.setProperty("auto.offset.reset", "earliest");
In the example above:

If kafka1 is down, the Kafka consumer will automatically try to connect to kafka2 or kafka3 and consume the messages from the available brokers.
Kafka consumers have an internal mechanism to handle failures and automatically connect to the available brokers.
4. Ensuring Data Continuity and Correctness:
Kafka Replication: As long as Kafka replication is set correctly (with a replication factor of 3, as mentioned in the setup), and data is replicated across the Kafka brokers, the failure of one broker (like kafka1) won't result in data loss. The consumers (e.g., Flink) will consume from the remaining brokers that have the replicated data.
Flink: If a JobManager fails, Flink will handle the failover and continue the execution using another JobManager. Similarly, Flink TaskManagers can continue processing the data as long as there are available TaskManagers to take over the work.
5. How Kafka Consumers (Flink) Will Handle Failover:
Kafka ensures that each consumer group reads from Kafka topics without data loss, using consumer group offsets. Flink, as a Kafka consumer, can use checkpointing and state snapshots to store offsets and maintain fault tolerance:

Flink will continue from the last successful checkpoint even after a failover. If the JobManager fails, the new leader JobManager will continue processing the job.
Kafka will store offsets and allow consumers to restart from the last committed offset even if one of the Kafka brokers goes down.
Summary of Behavior:
JobManager Failover: When jobmanager1 fails, jobmanager2 or jobmanager3 will automatically take over as leader, ensuring that the Flink job continues running without interruption.
Kafka Broker Failover: When kafka1 goes down, Kafka brokers kafka2 and kafka3 will still contain the topic data because of replication, ensuring that Flink can continue consuming from the remaining brokers.
JavaScript Consumer Handling: Flink or other Kafka consumers in JavaScript (or Java) can automatically handle failover by connecting to available Kafka brokers (kafka2, kafka3) if kafka1 goes down. This ensures that data processing continues without data loss.
The system should remain fully operational and continue processing data, even if one JobManager or one Kafka broker fails, as long as replication and failover mechanisms are properly configured.

# Flink-MySQL-Kafka HA Setup

This project sets up a high-availability integration with Apache Flink, Kafka, and MySQL using Docker. The setup ensures fault tolerance for both Kafka brokers and Flink JobManagers/TaskManagers.

## Folder Structure

- `docker-compose.yml`: Configuration for running Kafka, Flink, Zookeeper, and MySQL in Docker containers.
- `flink-job/`: Contains the Flink job code (`MySQLToKafkaJob.java`) for processing and sending data to Kafka.
- `mysql-init/`: Contains the initialization script for MySQL.

## Steps to Run

1. Build the Flink job:
    ```bash
    cd flink-job
    mvn clean package
    ```

2. Start the Docker containers:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

3. Copy the Flink job JAR to the JobManager:
    ```bash
    docker cp target/flink-mysql-kafka-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar flink-mysql-kafka-ha_jobmanager1_1:/opt/flink/job/
    ```

4. Submit the job:
    ```bash
    docker exec -it flink-mysql-kafka-ha_jobmanager1_1 flink run /opt/flink/job/flink-mysql-kafka-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```

5. Test failover by stopping Kafka brokers or JobManagers.

## Verification

- Check Flink dashboard: `http://localhost:8081`
- Verify Kafka consumer data:
    ```bash
    docker exec -it flink-mysql-kafka-ha_kafka1_1 kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server kafka1:9092 --topic output-topic --from-beginning
    ```
- Verify MySQL data.

## Troubleshooting

- If JobManager fails, Zookeeper will promote another JobManager to continue processing.
- Kafka replication ensures that data will not be lost even if one broker goes down.
To Run the Setup:
Build and package the Flink job: cd flink-job && mvn clean package
Start the services: docker-compose up -d
Submit the job to Flink: docker exec -it flink-mysql-kafka-ha_jobmanager1_1 flink run /opt/flink/job/flink-mysql-kafka-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
This setup ensures that the system will continue processing even if a JobManager or Kafka broker goes down, as long as the failover mechanisms are correctly configured.

Now how to test this setup give full steps
ChatGPT said:
To test the high-availability setup for your Kafka, Flink, and MySQL integration, follow these steps to verify the system’s fault tolerance and proper operation. The main tests will focus on ensuring that the system continues functioning seamlessly even if one Kafka broker or one JobManager fails.

Steps to Test the High Availability Setup
Step 1: Build and Package the Flink Job
Before starting, ensure you have built the Flink job.

Navigate to the flink-job directory:

bash
Copy
cd flink-job
Clean and package the Flink job:

bash
Copy
mvn clean package
Once the job is packaged, you will have the flink-mysql-kafka-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar file ready for deployment.

Step 2: Start the Docker Containers
Use docker-compose to bring up the entire cluster of Kafka, Flink, MySQL, and Zookeeper.

Navigate to the root folder of the project:

bash
Copy
cd ..
Start the services using Docker Compose:

bash
Copy
docker-compose up -d
This command will pull necessary Docker images, start Kafka brokers (kafka1, kafka2, kafka3), Zookeeper, JobManagers (jobmanager1, jobmanager2, jobmanager3), TaskManagers (taskmanager1, taskmanager2, taskmanager3), and MySQL.
It will also ensure that everything is connected as per the docker-compose.yml.
Verify that the containers are up and running:

bash
Copy
docker ps
Step 3: Deploy the Flink Job
Copy the Flink job JAR file to one of the JobManagers (e.g., jobmanager1):

bash
Copy
docker cp target/flink-mysql-kafka-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar flink-mysql-kafka-ha_jobmanager1_1:/opt/flink/job/
Submit the Flink job to the JobManager:

bash
Copy
docker exec -it flink-mysql-kafka-ha_jobmanager1_1 flink run /opt/flink/job/flink-mysql-kafka-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
This command will execute the job, which will consume data from MySQL and send it to Kafka.

Step 4: Monitor the Flink Dashboard
Open your web browser and go to the Flink dashboard to verify that the job is running correctly:

Flink JobManager 1: http://localhost:8081
JobManager 2: http://localhost:8082
JobManager 3: http://localhost:8083
In the Flink dashboard, ensure that the job is active and running. You should see the job in the "Jobs" tab.

Step 5: Verify Data in Kafka
To verify that the Flink job is successfully writing data to Kafka:

Run a Kafka consumer command to read from the Kafka topic (output-topic):

bash
Copy
docker exec -it flink-mysql-kafka-ha_kafka1_1 kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server kafka1:9092,kafka2:9093,kafka3:9094 --topic output-topic --from-beginning
The Kafka consumer will print the messages being consumed from the Kafka topic.
If the job is running correctly, you should see the messages from the MySQL database being printed.

Step 6: Test MySQL Data
Verify that the data is being consumed correctly from MySQL:

Connect to MySQL:

bash
Copy
docker exec -it flink-mysql-kafka-ha_mysql_1 mysql -u user -p
Enter the password (password) when prompted.

Check the data in the messages table to ensure that MySQL data is being inserted and consumed:

sql
Copy
USE testdb;
SELECT * FROM messages;
Step 7: Test Kafka Failover (Simulate Kafka Broker Failure)
To test Kafka's high availability, simulate the failure of one Kafka broker (kafka1) and verify that the system continues to operate seamlessly.

Stop kafka1:

bash
Copy
docker stop flink-mysql-kafka-ha_kafka1_1
Now, the Kafka consumer (and Flink) should automatically connect to kafka2 and kafka3. The system should continue reading and writing data.

You can re-run the Kafka consumer to ensure it is still receiving messages:

bash
Copy
docker exec -it flink-mysql-kafka-ha_kafka2_1 kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server kafka2:9093,kafka3:9094 --topic output-topic --from-beginning
If data continues to flow without interruption, Kafka failover is working properly.

Step 8: Test Flink JobManager Failover (Simulate JobManager Failure)
To test Flink’s high availability, simulate the failure of one JobManager (jobmanager1) and ensure that one of the other JobManagers takes over seamlessly.

Stop jobmanager1:

bash
Copy
docker stop flink-mysql-kafka-ha_jobmanager1_1
After a few seconds, the system will automatically promote another JobManager (jobmanager2 or jobmanager3) to take over the leadership role, and the job should continue running.

Go to the Flink dashboard again and verify that the job is still running.

If you see the job in the "Jobs" tab and the status remains active, Flink has handled the failover correctly.
Step 9: Test TaskManager Failover (Simulate TaskManager Failure)
To test TaskManager failover, stop one of the TaskManagers (taskmanager1) and verify that the workload is taken over by the remaining TaskManagers.

Stop taskmanager1:

bash
Copy
docker stop flink-mysql-kafka-ha_taskmanager1_1
The remaining TaskManagers (taskmanager2, taskmanager3) will pick up the tasks and continue processing.

Verify the task status in the Flink dashboard to ensure that the workload is redistributed and continues processing.

Step 10: Verify Full System Recovery
Restart kafka1 and jobmanager1:

bash
Copy
docker start flink-mysql-kafka-ha_kafka1_1
docker start flink-mysql-kafka-ha_jobmanager1_1
Verify that the Kafka consumer continues processing data from the last offset after both components come back online.

Check the MySQL database to ensure that new data is still being inserted.

Step 11: Clean Up
After testing, clean up the running Docker containers:

bash
Copy
docker-compose down
This will stop and remove all containers, networks, and volumes created by docker-compose.

Summary of Testing Steps
Build and package the Flink job: Ensure the job is built and ready to run.
Start the services: Run docker-compose up -d to bring up Kafka, Flink, Zookeeper, and MySQL.
Deploy and run the Flink job: Copy the job JAR to the JobManager and submit it.
Monitor Flink dashboard: Verify the job is running on the Flink dashboard.
Verify Kafka data: Check Kafka to see that data is flowing from MySQL through Flink.
Verify MySQL data: Ensure MySQL is being updated correctly.
Test Kafka failover: Simulate Kafka broker failure and ensure continued data flow.
Test Flink JobManager failover: Stop one JobManager and verify that another takes over.
Test TaskManager failover: Simulate TaskManager failure and ensure the remaining TaskManagers handle the workload.
Verify full system recovery: Restart Kafka and JobManager and ensure the system recovers properly.
Clean up: Shut down all containers.
By following these steps, you can ensure that the high-availability setup for Kafka, Flink, and MySQL is working properly and that the system will continue to function even in the event of component failures.

ChatGPT said:
The error you're seeing occurs because the class SimpleStringSchema is missing from your project, or it hasn't been imported. The SimpleStringSchema class is part of the Flink Kafka connector library, and you need to import it correctly.

Steps to Fix the Issue
Add the Missing Dependency: Ensure you have the correct Flink Kafka connector dependency in your pom.xml file.

Add the following Maven dependency to your pom.xml under the <dependencies> section if it's missing:

xml
Copy
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.flink</groupId>
    <artifactId>flink-connector-kafka_2.12</artifactId>
    <version>1.14.0</version>
</dependency>
Import the SimpleStringSchema Class: The SimpleStringSchema class is used to serialize/deserialize strings in Kafka consumers and producers. You need to import it at the top of your MySQLToKafkaJob.java file.

Add the following import at the top of your Java class:

java
Copy
import org.apache.flink.streaming.util.serialization.SimpleStringSchema;
Rebuild the Project: After adding the dependency and the import, rebuild your project:

bash
Copy
mvn clean package
Updated MySQLToKafkaJob.java Example:
Here's the full updated version of the job class with the proper import:

java
Copy
package com.example;

import org.apache.flink.api.common.functions.MapFunction;
import org.apache.flink.streaming.api.environment.StreamExecutionEnvironment;
import org.apache.flink.streaming.connectors.kafka.FlinkKafkaProducer;
import org.apache.flink.api.java.tuple.Tuple2;
import org.apache.flink.streaming.util.serialization.SimpleStringSchema;

public class MySQLToKafkaJob {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        final StreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();

        // Example: Consume from MySQL and send to Kafka
        env.fromElements(Tuple2.of("key", "value"))
            .map(new MapFunction<Tuple2<String, String>, String>() {
                @Override
                public String map(Tuple2<String, String> value) throws Exception {
                    return value.f0 + ": " + value.f1;
                }
            })
            .addSink(new FlinkKafkaProducer<String>(
                "kafka1:9092,kafka2:9093,kafka3:9094",  // Multiple Kafka brokers for failover
                "output-topic",                        // Kafka topic
                new SimpleStringSchema()               // Use SimpleStringSchema for serialization
            ));

        env.execute("MySQL to Kafka Job");
    }
}
Rebuild and Package Again:
After making these changes, try running the Maven build again:

bash
Copy
mvn clean package
Additional Considerations:
Kafka Version: Make sure that the version of flink-connector-kafka you are using matches your Flink version (in this case, 1.14.0). If you are using a different version of Flink, adjust the version in the Maven dependency accordingly.
This should resolve the compilation error you encountered. Let me know if you run into any other issues!

And what is parallesim mode
ChatGPT said:
Parallelism mode in the context of Apache Flink refers to how tasks within a Flink job are distributed and executed across the available resources (TaskManagers and CPU cores). Flink allows tasks to be run in parallel to leverage the available computational resources and increase the performance and throughput of your data processing jobs.

Key Concepts of Parallelism in Flink
Task Parallelism:

Task parallelism refers to the number of parallel instances (or tasks) of a particular operator (e.g., a map or filter operation) that are executed across multiple TaskManagers or CPU cores.
Each parallel task runs independently, processing a subset of the input data.
Global Parallelism:

Global parallelism defines the overall number of parallel tasks in the entire job. It determines how many parallel instances will be executed for the entire Flink job, across all operators.
Flink allows setting global parallelism via the StreamExecutionEnvironment:
java
Copy
env.setParallelism(4); // Set the global parallelism to 4
Operator Parallelism:

Flink allows different operators (e.g., map, filter, sink) to have different levels of parallelism, even in the same job.
You can set operator-specific parallelism like this:
java
Copy
myStream.map(new MyMapFunction()).setParallelism(3);  // Set parallelism for map operator
TaskManager Parallelism:

TaskManagers are the workers in a Flink cluster. They are responsible for executing parallel tasks.
The number of available TaskManagers and the number of available slots per TaskManager determines the maximum parallelism achievable.
The parallelism in Flink is constrained by the available slots (which represent resources like CPU cores and memory) in the TaskManagers.
How Parallelism Affects Flink Jobs
Improved Throughput: By increasing parallelism, Flink can process more data in less time by distributing the workload across multiple TaskManagers or CPU cores.
Fault Tolerance: Parallelism helps to ensure that the failure of a TaskManager does not significantly impact the job. If the task is distributed across multiple TaskManagers, the job can continue with minimal disruption.
Resource Utilization: Setting the correct parallelism helps to fully utilize available resources (e.g., CPU cores, memory), optimizing job execution.
Modes of Parallelism
Static Parallelism:

Static parallelism means that the parallelism is fixed at the time the job is submitted. The parallelism level remains constant throughout the entire job execution.
This can be set globally for the entire job or per operator, either programmatically or via the Flink configuration.
Dynamic Parallelism:

Dynamic parallelism allows the parallelism to be adjusted during job execution. It enables Flink to change the number of parallel tasks dynamically, depending on the workload, available resources, or external conditions (e.g., data volume or load balancing).
This can be achieved by reconfiguring Flink’s parallelism programmatically using setParallelism or by using job parameters.
Event Time Parallelism:

In event-time processing, the parallelism can be determined based on event timestamps, and the Flink operators can handle time-based events efficiently in parallel.
How to Set Parallelism in Flink
Global Parallelism:

To set a global parallelism level for the entire job:
java
Copy
env.setParallelism(4);  // Set global parallelism to 4 tasks
Operator Parallelism:

To set parallelism for individual operators (e.g., map, filter, or sink):
java
Copy
myStream.map(new MyMapFunction()).setParallelism(2);  // Set parallelism for map operator to 2
Per-TaskManager Parallelism:

TaskManagers themselves are divided into slots. Each slot can hold one or more parallel tasks. The number of slots per TaskManager can be configured via Flink’s configuration file (flink-conf.yaml):
yaml
Copy
taskmanager.numberOfTaskSlots: 4  # Set number of slots per TaskManager
Dynamic Adjustment:

Flink allows you to adjust parallelism dynamically based on runtime information (e.g., data stream rate, task failures, etc.), though this is generally more advanced and requires specific configuration.
Example of Parallelism in Flink Job
java
Copy
public class FlinkParallelismExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        // Set up the environment
        final StreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();

        // Set global parallelism to 4 tasks
        env.setParallelism(4);

        // Create a data stream source (could be from Kafka, file, etc.)
        DataStream<String> inputStream = env.fromElements("Hello", "World", "Flink", "Parallelism");

        // Set the parallelism for the map operator to 2 tasks
        inputStream.map(new MyMapFunction()).setParallelism(2)
            .addSink(new FlinkKafkaProducer<>(...));  // Example of sink

        // Execute the job
        env.execute("Flink Parallelism Example");
    }
}
Key Takeaways
Parallelism mode in Flink defines how tasks are distributed across the cluster and how many tasks will process the data in parallel.
Global parallelism can be set for the entire job, while operator parallelism can be configured individually for each operator.
TaskManager parallelism depends on the number of TaskManagers and the number of slots available on each.
Higher parallelism increases resource utilization and throughput, but requires adequate hardware resources (TaskManagers and slots) to prevent overloading.
Understanding and configuring parallelism appropriately is key to optimizing Flink job performance and ensuring scalability and fault tolerance in a distributed environment.

Limit cpu and memory storage in docker compose file as i am very low on it
ChatGPT said:
To limit CPU and memory usage for your Docker containers in the docker-compose.yml file, you can use the mem_limit, cpu_limit, and other resource-related options under the deploy section. These settings are used to limit the resources for each container.

Below is an updated version of your docker-compose.yml file with memory and CPU limits set for Kafka, Flink, MySQL, and Zookeeper. These limits should help you control the resource usage of the containers when you're running on a machine with limited resources.

Key Changes:
Resource Limits for Each Service:

Memory: The memory key under deploy.resources.limits is used to limit the maximum memory each service can consume.
CPU: The cpus key under deploy.resources.limits restricts the number of CPU cores each service can use.
Resource Reservations:

Reservations are the minimum resources allocated for the container. These values help the orchestrator decide how much memory and CPU are needed to run the container even before it starts.
For instance, cpu: 0.5 means the container is limited to half of a single CPU core, and memory: 512M limits the container to 512MB of RAM.
Explanation of Resource Allocation:
Zookeeper: 512MB of memory and 0.5 CPUs. Zookeeper handles coordination between Kafka and Flink, so it's lightweight but still requires some memory and CPU.
Kafka: Each Kafka broker (kafka1, kafka2, kafka3) is limited to 1GB of memory and 1 CPU. Kafka brokers are more resource-intensive, especially when managing topics and partitions.
Flink JobManagers: Each JobManager is limited to 1GB of memory and 1 CPU. JobManagers handle the coordination and scheduling of tasks within Flink.
Flink TaskManagers: Each TaskManager is limited to 512MB of memory and 0.5 CPUs. TaskManagers perform the actual data processing, so they are given reasonable but limited resources.
MySQL: The MySQL container is limited to 512MB of memory and 0.5 CPUs, as it's expected to handle a relatively low load.
How to Apply These Changes:
Save the changes to your docker-compose.yml file.

Rebuild and restart the services:

bash
Copy
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
These limits will ensure that your Docker containers do not consume more resources than available on your machine, which should be helpful when running in an environment with limited CPU and memory.
